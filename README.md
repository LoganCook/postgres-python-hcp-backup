## Information
Python based backup script for postgresql databases. The resulting backup file is dumped to the Hitachi Content Platform <br>
<br>
Run this script as the postgresql user on your system via a crontab. <br>
You'll need a working HCP namespace with the appropriate services configured (HTTPS).
<br>
An HCP authentication token is required to put data into a namespace. <br>
<br>
This is generated by base64 encoding the username following by a ":" and the md5sum of the password. <br>
Please see the HCP administration guide for details.<br>

## Requirements
 * Python 2.7
 * Pycurl module
 * /tmp needs enough space to dump a full database backup.
